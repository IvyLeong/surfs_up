The data shows that the data count for June temperature is 1700, the mean is 74.94 F with standard deviation of 3.25 F. The minimum temperature for June is 64.00F and the maximum temperature is 85.00F. For December, the data count is 1517, the mean temperature is 71.04F with standard deviation of 3.75F. The minimum temperature is 56.00F and the maximum temperature is 83.00F in December. The results show that the average temperature in June is 3F higher than in December, which did not show much difference between those 2 months. The maximum temperature in June and December are about the same while the minimum temperature in December is about 8F lower than that in June. Some days in December with lower temperature may affect the surf and ice cream business. The data points in June are 200 more than in December, which may make the comparable less reliable. We can further analyze the temperature data for the whole season, June-Aug vs. Dec-Feb, and get a better understanding of the seasonal effects for the future business. We can also compare the specific stations of the temperature in June and December and see if specific location has more seasonal change. Besides, the precipitation data can be analyzed for the difference between June and December and the results would provide some meaningful seasonal business decisions.
